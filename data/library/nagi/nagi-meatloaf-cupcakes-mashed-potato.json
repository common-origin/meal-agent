    "description": "Everything tastes better in miniature form! These Meatloaf Cupcakes are made extra irresistible by piling on mashed potato. These freeze very well. They are also great for hiding vegetables. I only added grated carrot, but you can mix in whatever vegetables you want. Finely chopped spinach or cabbage would blend in well, as would grated zucchini.",

My toddler even loved them.\r\nI did make a couple adjustments by using minced garlic instead of garlic powder then adding a little Worcestershire Sauce and Dijon Mustard to the meatloaf mixture for a kick. I used heavy cream in place of the milk in the potatoes and added a little roasted garlic.\r\nI also made my own sauce instead of using just ketchup but, 10/10 definitely recommend!!! The grated carrots were a great touch!\r\nThank you for sharing! Saving this one in the book!!!",
