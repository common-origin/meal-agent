    "description": "This Chinese noodle soup is a flavour explosion in a bowl, is &lt;300 cal per serving and only takes just over 10 minutes to make. It is spicy, salty and slightly sour with the fragrance of sesame, with a thicker soup than the usual clear noodle soup stocks and I love the creamy colour and texture which comes from the sesame paste (or tahini), corn starch and the starch from cooking the noodles in the stock. Substitute the vegetables with whatever you have on hand and use whatever noodles you want.",

It is our favourite by far, and has since become our friend's/family's favourite too. I always stick to the original recipe and measurements, with the only change using garlic oil (garlic is no-go for me). I do however vary the toppings based on what is in the fridge - lately my favourite is grated zucchini. I wouldn't normally comment with advice, but I've had the tahini split many times and found that if I stick to the following tips it doesn't happen anymore! I always mix in a little of the Stock first to the Stock Sauce, to make a better \"blend\". Most importantly, make sure the Stock is never hot or boiling prior to adding the Stock Sauce. Keep stirring. Only allow it the mix to come to a boil once you've added noodles, and keep stirring. I just hope that helps anyone else who tries this AMAZING recipe. Thank you Nagi, love your work!",
