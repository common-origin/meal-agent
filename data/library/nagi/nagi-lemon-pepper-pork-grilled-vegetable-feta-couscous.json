I patted the chops with lemony olive oil before adding lemon pepper and left for about 10mins for the flavours to intense.\r\n\r\nWow, the veges were a highlight for me, the colours and flavours were perfect.    I also whacked in some corn cobs and since MOTH really enjoys beetroot, I cubed a few slices and this added another flavour that seriously worked well.\r\n\r\nThe meal was so quick to prepare and cook and gosh, the washing up was next to nothing.\r\n\r\nWe really enjoyed this one (as usual), thanks Nagi.",
