    "description": "Stacked tacos! These are made with layers of tortillas, Pork Carnitas (Mexican Shredded Pork) or Chicken, Corn and Tomato Salsa and melted cheese. Fun, fabulous and easy. If you make this with leftover Pork Carnitas then it's super quick too! Serves 2 very hungry people or 4 dieting people. Note: This stack is made with meat that is juicy and moist so all that is needed is a dollop of sour cream to finish it off. If you are concerned your meat is too dry, I suggest having a side sauce to add moisture.",
