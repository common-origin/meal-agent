    "description": "This is the cubanos sandwich recipe from the 2014 movie Chef. The food in the recipe was created by real life rock star chef Roy Choi. This is the actual recipe from the movie! It was published on thestar.com. This is supposed to be made with a panini / sandwich press but I do not have one so I've provided instructions for how to make this in a skillet. AND these are great for freezing! Refer Note 1 for instructions.",
