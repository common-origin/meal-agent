    "description": "Sometimes you've just gotta have mash but you simply don't have the energy (or time) to peel, cut, boil and mash potatoes. On such occasions, this Garlic White Bean Mash In A Flash is simply fabulous to satisfy your craving - suitably named because it requires such little effort to make. I made this as a side for my Healthy Parmesan Garlic Crumbed Fish to make a complete meal in 15 minutes. This recipe is also great to use as a topping for bruschetta.",
