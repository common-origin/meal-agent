It turned out delicious! Something to note, I used a 9x13 glass casserole dish. It took a lot longer to cook. Closer to 45 mins. I suspect it was due to the glass dish and I used more than 2 cups of chicken. Another great recipe, Nagi!",

        "reviewBody": "This worked really well. I used leftover pulled pork and made the suggested enchilada sauce as it was much cheaper than buying a jar of ready made sauce. I also used 8 tortillas and just cut them in half and placed the flat side on the four edges of a small square baking dish which meant I got 4 layers. I had never made a tortilla bake before but seeing how incredibly easy they are and how well they turn out, I will be making this and other similar recipes from now on. Thanks for posting Nagi, you rock!",

My mom who is as white as they come, but had the good fortune  to marry a great Mexican from Yuma, Arizona made this recipe for us when we were young. No black beans she used pinto instead. In fact I sent this to my sister and she couldn't believe it! Now this may not sound so unusual but I'm 62 and she's 58! Thanks for memories long forgotten.",
