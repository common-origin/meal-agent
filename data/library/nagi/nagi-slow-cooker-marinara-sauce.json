    "description": "A good marinara sauce is an essential for everyone. I love this one because you just dump the ingredients into a slow cooker then leave it to work it's magic. The slow cooking caramelises the sugar in the tomato and creates a depth of flavour you will never get from store bought pasta sauce.",

My husband says it is just like the sauce his Italian mumma made (high praise indeed!).\r\nQuestion: onion and garlic is added to the slow cooker when making the marinara, but in the section titled \"To use for pasta\", there is also onion and garlic sauteed before adding the marinara and then the pasta. Would it be one onion and 2 cloves garlic per 500g dried pasta?",
