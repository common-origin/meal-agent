    "description": "This is one of those recipes that is easy enough for midweek but elegant enough for company - at least, in my opinion! By baking the chicken on top of the potato, the juices mingles with the salty prosciutto then drips down onto the potato, adding extra (serious) flavour oomph!",

I might have miscalculated the amount of potatoes and  spread the slices a bit too thinly, so some of them got a bit too crispy, but since I made this for myself that didn’t matter because I love crispy😊 The next time I make this I think I’m going to add something saucy, like either a cold sauce or some coleslaw-like salad.",
