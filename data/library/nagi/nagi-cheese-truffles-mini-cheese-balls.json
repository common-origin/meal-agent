    "description": "These mini cheese balls are cute and a nice change up from the usual giant cheese balls you see. You don't have to worry about the giant cheese ball becoming a mess when people get stuck into it because each ball is a single serving and you get to use different coatings to make a kaleidoscope of colours! I've provided 3 different fillings so you can choose which one you want to make (or make all three!). In the photo you see, I made all 3 but you can't tell in the photo because the filling of all 3 look pretty much the same.",
