    "description": "With few clever shortcuts and a bit of multi tasking, you'll get this complete dinner on the table in 15 minutes. The crunchy crumbed chicken is sensational. The secret is mayonnaise which is used to make the panko breadcrumbs stick to the chicken, plus it provides the seasoning.",

I've made the mash and cucumber salad too (equally delish and super easy). Here's my 2 cents - I cook the chicken in my cast iron pan on the lower rack in the oven on broil - sometimes it cooks a bit quickly so I'll start broiling until it begins to brown well, then cover it in foil to make sure the chicken cooks but doesn't burn, then remove the foil and then crisp it up at the end. Magic!",
