        "reviewBody": "It took me a couple of attempts to get this perfect but my third go came out perfectly. I do find that cooking it for longer over a lower heat (15 min a side, medium heat) makes for a beautifully golden crust and I also prefer to cook it in butter, just browned which also contributes to the delicious flavour. I like to add some very finely diced garlic and chopped rosemary and parsley (only because that's what I have in the garden currently) to the grated potatoes... I rinse and wring mine out in a sieve lined with chux dishcloths because I'm lazy and it's way easier... and I have found this to be the ABSOLUTELY PERFECT base for Eggs Florentine. Like, I made this for brunch last weekend and got marriage proposals even though my husband was right there (he may have been slightly smug about the whole thing, until it was time to clear the table at least, ha ha!)\r\n\r\nThe best advice I can offer other readers is to make sure you have a plate big enough to easily invert your frying pan or skillet onto easily!!! And as much as I want to try this in my Lodge cast iron, I don't think I have the strength and coordination to juggle that sucker without risking it all.\r\n\r\nA winner for me, for sure!",
