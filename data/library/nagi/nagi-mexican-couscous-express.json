    "description": "The most ridiculously easy and fast mid week meal that's darn tasty and wonderfully light. Feel free to ramp up the toppings - I just added some diced avocado and tomato to keep it fresh, but I also have it with a dollop of source cream and grated cheese. And I have also been known to add crispy tortilla chips tooâ€¦.",

I will admit that I did a little bit of tweaking (didn't have the jalapeÃ±os, don't like cumin, not enough beans or corn, way less salt.....) but I'm so excited with how well it turned out! We topped it with tomato, avocado, and a little lime juice. (: I'd have eaten a lot more couscous by now if hadn't taken me so long to find such a good recipe.",

I made the couscous without the optional toppings, kept those separate so the kids could create their own dishes at the table, as per your suggestion I also made the Carnitas as well to be used as a topping - kids whoofed down their creations (avocado, tomatoe, cucumber, grated cheese and pork).   Great easy, mid-week dinner for a busy mum!",
