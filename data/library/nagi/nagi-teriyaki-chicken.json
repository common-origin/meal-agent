    "description": "Make your own Teriyaki Sauce at home - not only is it easy, fast and more tasty, the marinade infuses into the flesh better. Make a larger batch and store it in the fridge so you have it on hand for a quick meal! Also great to cook on the outdoor grill/BBQ. Though not strictly a 15 minute meal because of the marinating time, I have classified it in 15 minute meals because the cooking and active prep time is less than 15 minutes.",
