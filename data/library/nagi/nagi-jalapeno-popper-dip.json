    "description": "Jalapeno Poppers - in dip form! This dip is warm, creamy and cheesy with a lovely kick from the Jalapeños. It's not overly spicy because the jalapeño is balanced out by the creaminess. Most Jalapeño Popper dips have similar ingredients except I use canned rather than fresh jalapeños. The slight tang from the brining liquid is great to cut through the richness of the dip. Also I use slightly more sour cream than most so the dip stays soft even when it cools. This makes 4 cups of dip, enough for 1 large cob loaf (put leftovers in ramekins and make smaller ones).",
