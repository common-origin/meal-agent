    "description": "Succulent chicken with a lip smacking honey-lemon sauce. Dinner in a snap - 5 minutes prep, 4 minutes to cook the chicken, 3 minutes for the sauce = 12 minute dinner! Dusting the chicken in flour makes the skin slightly crispy which makes the sauce cling to it. Recipe VIDEO below!",
