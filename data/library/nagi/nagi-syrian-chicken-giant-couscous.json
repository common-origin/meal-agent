    "description": "This is a simple but exotic dish of chicken with a spiced crispy skin baked with a rich tomato broth. It is served with Giant Couscous (also known as Moghrabieh, Israeli or Pearl Couscous) which can be substituted with ordinary couscous, pasta (risoni/orzo), rice, polenta or even mashed potato.",

The flavor and aromatics literally transport you to somewhere else as you are eating. I bet it would pair nicely with your Rice Pilaf with nuts and dried fruit...which is also a family favorite. I'm so glad I stumbled upon your site. Thanks for the wonderful recipes.",

I cooked it on an induction cooktop because I don't have an oven at the moment. I found that I had to cook my chicken thighs (bone in) for about an hour, not 35 mins as suggested. Maybe they were larger than those used by testers or maybe I used lower cooking temp on the cooktop? Anyway, can definitely recommend this lovely dish served with basmati rice. So glad I found it.",

Regarding this Syrian recipe, is there a way to keep the crunchy skin from becoming soft once you place the chicken in the tomato juices, broth and you put the lid on the pan? I love this technique, but inevitably get chicken with soft skin every time I do it. Thank you, Nagi. Keep up the great work!",
