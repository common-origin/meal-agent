    "description": "Juicy pork tenderloin smothered in a Creamy Marsala Sauce with Mushrooms. It's like gravy - but even better because the sauce has beautiful layers of flavour in it from the Marsala. Using wine in cooking is how posh restaurants make such beautiful sauces! Use this Marsala Sauce for other proteins like chicken, veal and beef.&nbsp;",

I mostly followed the recipe but I did marinade the tenderloin with a herb rub and felt like it gave the dish an extra layer of depth to all the lovely flavors.
