I must say, no regrets on not waiting because they were to die for. \r\nThough, we did a minor change of adding the sour cream onto skins and baking them all together instead of adding the sour cream on top afterwards once they were out of the oven and done. We will totally be making these again! :D \r\nI am into food photography so I decided to photograph the delicious creation and share the picture along with you: http://fav.me/dcayahr",

You have elevated yourself to goddess status in our home now. These are so crisp, so delicious, &amp; incredibly versatile. I added yellow onion to some (with the bacon &amp; cheese to bake), I put guacamole on some instead of sour cream, then on the others I used that sauce you gave with the potato wedges (sour cream &amp; sweet chili). They are freakin' AMAZING!! \r\nThe family is going to collapse with joy. When I opened the oven I'm pretty sure I heard angels sing.",
