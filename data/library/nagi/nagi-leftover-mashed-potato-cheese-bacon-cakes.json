    "description": "This might be called \"Leftover Mashed Potato\" cakes but most of the time, I will make mashed potatoes especially to make these! Great for breakfast, lunch OR dinner! I made these with bacon but they're also lovely with canned tuna (drained of oil) or even diced cooked chicken or any other protein.",

I admit because I only had 1 cup of mashed potato and 1.5 cups of a mix of mashed potato/cauliflower/brocolli the mixture was a bit too \"wet\", but it used up my leftovers.  The first ones fell apart in the pan (but tasted great).  I formed the rest and put into the fridge overnight and they held shape the next day.   They were so good I will cook mashed potato to make them 100% to the recipe.  Great comfort food!",

Your recipe is fabulous.  I don't know if it is cooling the potato (never done that before) the cheese (never added that before) or the egg (which I often skip) but they held together and taste fantastic.  Thank you so much for the time you put into perfecting a recipe so we can enjoy the benefits.",
