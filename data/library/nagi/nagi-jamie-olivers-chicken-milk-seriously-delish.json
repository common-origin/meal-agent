    "description": "Though the ingredients list might seem odd, this is actually one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had. Possibly the best roast chicken I've ever had. It's incredibly easy to make and produces a very tender chicken with crispy skin on top. The braising liquid reduces to a fabulous sauce that has a hint of freshness from the lemon and muskiness from the sage and cinnamon. The whole cloves of garlic cook in the skin so they are soft and mushy (mild garlic flavour, much more sweet), perfect for popping out of the skin and eating with the chicken, or spread it on toast! The milk dissolves into bits of curd which remind me of bocconcini and taste like little bursts of creaminess.",

The leg meat stays succulent making it more edible than traditional roasting and I find that I also use more of the whole bird such as for sandwich meat. Basically no dry bits!\r\nHaving missed out the sage or garlic bulbs (replaced with a tablespoon of minced) a couple of times as I didn't have them, it seems the lemon peel and cinnamon are the real carriers of flavour. That said the bulbs are delicious as a spread with chicken on turkish bread!",

I really loved the tenderness of the chicken! I made it without sage, cause I didn’t he a any, and put oregano instead. And the garlic!!!! With roasted sweet and white potatoes and green peas!!
