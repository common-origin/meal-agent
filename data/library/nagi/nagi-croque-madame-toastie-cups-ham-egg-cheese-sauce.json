I know I'm weird, but I don't like bread, so this was perfect for me too ~ \r\njust enough bread to hold it together, but not so much that I had to deconstruct my sandwich \r\nto enjoy it. This is going to be a go-to for breakfast when we have guests &amp; will be a regular \r\n\"breakfast for dinner\" choice for us when it's just we two. \r\nThanks again!",
