I have even added vegetables to the skewers to make it last longer (I know - shock/horror at the vegetables). The sauce is amazing. Though I struggle to have any left to pour over the meat once it is all cooked, as I am cooking on a weber bbq, I think some of the basting might get a little lost over the grill... though I could be cooking too much chicken - but that could never happen. \r\nThe rice is also so lovey. My mother is growing fresh herbs on the balcony and they are forever going right into that rice... as well as her lime tree is coming in handy. \r\nI was just scouring your site for another chicken recipe and this one came up in my sights again... so I thought I would leave a quick note. \r\nAs I have said before, the humans in this house thank you for your recipes.",
