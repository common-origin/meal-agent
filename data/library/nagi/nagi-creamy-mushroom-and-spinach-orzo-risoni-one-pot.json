Just decadent!\r\n\r\nNagi, do you have any suggestions on how to do this recipe with the sauce and pasta separate? I was thinking of cutting the milk and chicken broth by 1/2 and keeping everything else the same. My reason for wanting to do this is so I could save some for lunch the next day, and I think it would hold up better if I could just add the sauce to the pasta.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for a delectable recipe!",
