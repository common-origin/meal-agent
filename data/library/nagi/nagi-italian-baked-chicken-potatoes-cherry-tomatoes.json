    "description": "Turn every day ingredients into something special! The chicken does not need to be marinated because this recipe makes a wonderful sauce, but if you do then it will be even more tasty. I like to par boil the potatoes because I really love how it sucks up the flavour of the Italian Dressing. But you can skip this step if you prefer to cook it all in the oven - refer to Note 4 for steps.",
