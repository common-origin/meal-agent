    "description": "This vegetarian/vegan version of chow mein is very close to the traditional version, but I have created a sauce without oyster sauce in it - and obviously substituted the meat with tofu. This recipe contains directions to make this from scratch as well as the directions for making this using my Real Chinese All Purpose Stir Fry Sauce (Vegetarian version) which, if you have a stash of it on hand, makes this super quick to make because you already have the sauce ready made!",
