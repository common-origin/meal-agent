I added some finely diced zucchini as well as finely diced mushrooms and I think I probably increased the meat/sauce to get five pies out of this; but I don’t think you could go wrong tweaking this recipe slightly, because the base of slow cooked beef cheeks and sauce is just so freaking perfect. I just wish beef cheeks would become cheap again so that I could make this more often! I love a lot of Nagi recipes but this might just be the best.",
