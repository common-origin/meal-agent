    "description": "Using leftover Pork Carnitas (Mexican Pulled Pork) or other shredded meat, it takes a mere 15 minutes to assemble this dish to pop into the oven, making this a sensational mid week meal! Note that the Pork Carnitas used in this recipe is already seasoned and flavoured so if you substitute with an unseasoned meat then please refer to the notes for seasonings to add to the filling mixture.",

The meat was a simple pork shoulder recipe, roasted low and slow, so I took your tips on adding seasoning to the meat. Looking back, I didn’t remember the combo correctly and unnecessarily added ground chile powder, but it still turned out delicious.\r\n\r\nI’ve made your sauce before with the beef enchiladas recipe, though I had some cans of pre-made sauce in the pantry that I needed to use before they expired. Rosarita makes legit enchilada sauce, though I definitely prefer your recipe. \r\n\r\nI will definitely make these again.",
