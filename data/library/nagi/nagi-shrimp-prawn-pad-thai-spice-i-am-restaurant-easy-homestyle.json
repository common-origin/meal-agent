    "description": "This is an authentic recipe for Pad Thai from the Spice I Am cookbook,&nbsp;one of the most critically acclaimed Thai restaurants in Sydney. This is a very traditional recipe for those who like truly authentic Thai street food as the dried shrimp flavour is stronger than what you get in westernised Pad Thai recipes. For something more like what you get at mainstream Thai restaurants, use this&nbsp;Everyday Pad Thai recipe.&nbsp;",

Thankfully now I have something to do with my enormous pot of Thai Basil. Pad Thai is my fav and this was so good.",

        "reviewBody": "Coming back to this one to say I think I've found a workaround for when dried shrimp (which I agree are 100% essential) are out of stock or otherwise hard to source. If you buy whole raw prawns and de-shell them yourself, you can bake the heads and shells (I blast at 220 for 15 minutes then 135 for an hour) to cook and completely dry them out, then blend into a fine powder which can be used either as instructed, or to sprinkle over in the end as a condiment. The best part is that the amount of prawn shells/heads you need to make 50g of dried powder is almost the exact amount you'll end up with after processing the raw prawns required for the rest of the recipe. It's a little extra legwork and it may not be quite as potent as the factory produced stuff, but it's neat to be able to use up the parts of the prawn that might otherwise get chucked away.",
