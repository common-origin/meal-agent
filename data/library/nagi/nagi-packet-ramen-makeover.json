    "description": "Transform packet ramen by topping it with stir fried vegetables in a glossy sauce! You can use whatever vegetables you want for this, just make sure you put them in the wok in order of length of time to cook, starting with the longest. Make it even healthier by using low sodium packet ramen. If you can manage the stir fry while you boil the noodles, you'll get this on the table in 10 minutes!",

(25 years easy) I can still remember the artificial taste.? \r\nThese noodles didn't have that artificial flavour. I was impressed with the flavours/spices.\r\nJust had to try this though . Hubbie found the same ramen noodles in our grocery store (just lucky). I was worried they would be crazy spicy , but they weren't...though for sure warms ya up!\r\nThis dish was fantastic! What a wonderful way to jazz up a package of ramen noodles! And so quick and easy . Definitely a recipe I will be keeping and using again.",

My husband and I liked it anyway. We didn't get super hot ramen either, which was nice. I just used white wine for the wine. And I used maitake mushrooms because I couldn't find shitake, not sure how much that changed the flavour. Really great dish anyways. I usually use ramen in cream soup or as spaghetti so I can just microwave it, or there's this great green beans and beef recipe that calls for it, but this was a nice change.",

All around fast and easy dish and I love the spice so much I stir fried some red chilies at the very beginning to kick it up even more! \r\nLove love love your blog, I have yet to make a recipe of yours  that has disappointed!",
