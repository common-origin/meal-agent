I made this recipe yesterday at breakfast for 8 it was so fast and easy even the clean up was simple, as I did every thing except the egg the night before. Warming the potato/sausage for those who like runny yolks and just popping the egg in at the start for those who didn't, they were all ready at the same time!!!",

Your recipes look delicious and your notes seal the deal.",
