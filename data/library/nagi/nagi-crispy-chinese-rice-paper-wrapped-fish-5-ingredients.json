        "reviewBody": "Hi Nagi ... cooked this last night and had similar issues to other reviewers with the rice paper. Pan and oil were certainly hot but the rice paper on the bottom (only one layer thick) essentially disintegrated in the oil. This then allowed the fish etc to ‘escape’. While very tasty, I think perhaps the fish needs to be thinner so when wrapping you get at least 2 layers on the bottom and maybe medium heat rather than medium hot. Will try again and let you know. Going to cook your brilliant Singapore Noodles tonight.",
