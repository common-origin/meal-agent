    "description": "Aloo Paratha is a very popular breakfast dish in India. The beauty of this recipe is how flexible it is - there are so many options and variations you can do and I've provided a bunch of suggestions in the notes. The dough is extremely simple to make and handle. The only \"must do\" in this recipe is letting the dough rest for 20 minutes.",

I did have problems with my coconut oil smoking- it's supposed to handle up to 365 degrees, but it looked like it'd catch fire at medium heat! I tried to roll some thinner, but the filling leaked through while cooking. The filling is good, but I never have scallions so I substituted giant bbq green onions and some colby jack I needed to use up. Next time I'd stuff naan or use the flatbread recipe and eat them like tacos, since high-heat oil is expensive and/or unhealthy.",
