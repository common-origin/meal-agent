    "description": "This is like a homemade vegetable antipasto that costs a fraction of store bought, tastes better and you know is preservative free. Whether as a starter or a vegetarian main, this is one of those dishes that proves that simple is best. This recipe includes a Yoghurt Sauce which gives this a Middle Eastern touch. Use whatever vegetables you want, so long as they are suitable for grilling.",

Without side sauce, simply didn't need it. Added some mushrooms and worked really well. I've tried many recipies for baked veggies with all sorts of marinades to enhance the flavour, but cannot compare with this grilled bowl of goodness!",

In NZ it’s another name for some varieties of pumpkin but that doesnt seem right if I’m grilling it with all the other vegetables. Maybe if cut thin enough will cook too. Can you confirm please? \r\nI enjoyed this menu at a friends luncheon recently so copying her! It was delicious! Thank you!",
