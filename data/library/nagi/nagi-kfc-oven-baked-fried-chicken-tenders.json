    "description": "Crunchy and perfectly seasoned, it really does taste like KFC! It is a mash up of my own recipe, the \"11 Secret Herbs and Spices\" from the Homemade KFC recipe by Every Nook &amp; Cranny, and the coating recipe from this Best Baked \"Fried\" Chicken by Carlsbad Cravings.. Marinating makes the chicken extra juicy but if you don't have time to marinate, this is still worth making! (See Note 3) PS I know it looks like a lot of salt but it's not overly salty, it's KFC level salty. Reduce salt and/or celery salt if desired.",
