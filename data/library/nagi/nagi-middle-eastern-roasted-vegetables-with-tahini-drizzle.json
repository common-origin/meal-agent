    "description": "A simple Middle Eastern dish that's perfect for using up left over veggies at the end of a week. You can use any vegetables you want, just make sure to cut them to size so they cook in roughly the same time. Stuffed into pitas, it makes a wonderful light meal or lunch, or a perfect side.",
