    "description": "I can't say with certainty that this is authentic because it's a recipe I created. But it uses classic Middle Eastern ingredients, so possibly it is! The lamb is really juicy because it's made with lamb shoulder, a cut that is made for slow cooking. The pan frying step to get the crunchy brown bits is not optional - it's key! ! ! As with any shredded meat recipe, a little goes a long way. This makes around 8 cups of shredded lamb which I think is enough to serve 8 people as a main (with rice). See separate recipe below for Chickpea Pilaf (Rice).",

I didnâ€™t sear it for the first night but did for leftover night and the crunchy bits were soooo good. I paired this with homemade tabbouli and pita, and store bought hummus. Fresh lemon wedges were a must! This will go into my rotation, for sure.",
