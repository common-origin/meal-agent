And I was so happy with the end result!\r\n\r\nThe dark 'char' was in great part to the dried spices cooking into the chicken.  The flavour was not one of burned, but rather, as promised, a deep roast chicken flavour.  The thighs were tender and flavourful, and the potatoes cooked perfectly!\r\n\r\nThis was an easy to prepare dish with great results.  Thank you Nagi, and team, for another \r\nlovely recipe.\r\n\r\n\"Cheers\"! to you and your sweet boy, Dozer!\r\n\r\nFrom, \r\nThe Canadian Prairies",
