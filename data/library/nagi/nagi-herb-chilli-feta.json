    "description": "A cost effective starter that tastes as delightful as it looks and takes minutes to prepare. You could also make this just by serving a whole block of feta, but cutting it into cubes makes it easier to serve and also you get a better feta/olive oil/herb ratio with every bite!",

But I found that the olive oil solidified in the fridge.\r\n\r\nThe store bought varieties don't seem to suffer from this – and whilst I love &amp; prefer olive oil (being Italian it’s like our lifeblood !), I wonder should I use a different type of oil for this recipe ?  What are your thoughts ?\r\n\r\nOr maybe I just continue to bring it out of the fridge 10-15mins before use - which is a bit of a pain, but perhaps worth it for the superior flavour of the oil.",

I will be making this again and not telling anyone so I can keep them in the fridge for when I want them.",

I made all but the koftas and the chickpea salad when we had a couple friends over for dinner last Friday. We loved every dish, and I will make all of them again in the future! It took me longer than an hour, maybe closer to an hour and a half, but I chalk that up to being unfamiliar with the recipes. Still super quick for putting together such an amazing, restaurant-quality spread!",

I had her make this for our NYE celebration tonight. She added the chilli into the oil, along with the garlic. She let the oil sit for about 4 hrs before mixing it all together. I have to say that watching her drizzle the oil was PAINFUL; she was doing it drop by drop. I finally stopped her &amp; asked what was wrong. \r\n\"I'm scared\"\r\n\"Of what sweetie?\"\r\nShe tenses her face &amp; says \"I'm scared this will make my cheese taste gross\"\r\n\"Beth, it's ok to be scared....but you have to trust Nagi. She says this is a really good dish\"\r\nWith resignation she dumped the oil on, tossed the feta, grabbed a toothpick &amp; took a bite. \r\n\"OMG Mom!! THIS IS SO GOOD!!!\"\r\n\r\nYou've done it again Nagi. I give this recipe TEN STARS!! You're the best! \r\nAll our love from Canada &amp; Happy New Year!",
