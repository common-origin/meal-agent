    "description": "Apple cider is the secret to a marinade that makes pork tenderloin incredibly moist with a gorgeous glaze! The marinade also does double duty as the sauce. You will be amazed at the incredible flavour in this with so few ingredients! I used Rochdale Apple Cider for this recipe - a New Zealand cider that is available at all major liquor outlets in Australia including Dan Murphy's and Liquorland.",
