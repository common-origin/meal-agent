    "description": "These buttery biscuits have the texture of shortbread with the kick of parmesan cheese flavour. The biscuits are buttery and have a \"soft crumble\" when you bite into them. IMPORTANT: Please ensure you measure the ingredients by weight. Cup sizes measure between countries and so for accuracy reasons, I have written the recipe by weight rather than cups because this recipe requires accurate measurement of ingredients to achieve the desired result.",
