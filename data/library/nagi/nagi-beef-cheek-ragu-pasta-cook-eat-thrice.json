I have a family of men to feed so I increased the recipe size to 500g pasta, and increased the beef and sauce accordingly. On my first run I forgot to increase the amount of tomato paste. Second time: 1 mini tin of tomato paste was just right to make the finished sauce rich and tomato-y! I love this and so did the blokes of the family! Thanks for your recipes. Bless you.",
