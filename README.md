## Design System

This project uses the [Common Origin Design System](https://common-origin-design-system.vercel.app/) with components like:

- `Avatar` - User profile pictures with initials fallback
- `Stack` - Flexible layout primitive with gap control
- `Typography` - Semantic text hierarchy (h1-h6, body, small, etc.)

*Note: Currently experiencing React version compatibility issues between Next.js 16 (React 19) and the design system (React 18). Working with the design system team to resolve.*
